Bulldogs In Bulldogs!, you play a group of \"freebooting ruffians flying from planet to planet causing trouble\". It's a fun, fast system that lets you quickly get into the action and tell compelling stories. A few things stand out to me about Bulldogs: An fun, sometimes wild mix of races, including snake people Saldrallans, slug spacer Tetsuashans, and my personal favorites, the Urseminites, who are murderous teddy bears-- think Rocket Raccoon from Guardians, but with more war crimes. Also: those are just a few from the core book, and the expansions provide even more. A good setting, with two massive star empires and the Frontier Zone between them (where you hang out), which is a patchwork of little jurisdictions and petty tyrants. Out in the Frontier Zone, your reputation, your weapons, and your cunning may be all you have. An interesting system that's focused on improvisational stories. Bulldogs uses the Fate system, which is fun and flexible and places a premium on telling good stories. Like other RPG systems, you sometimes roll dice to find out what happens. Unlike other RPG systems, the players are also constantly participating, by making interesting choices for their characters and adding details and plot elements to the story. Star Trek Adventures in the Ganna Quadrant Play Starfleet officers in the age of Captain Picard and the Enterprise-D. According to most people, the Star Trek Adventures system isn't anything to write home about, but it does a good job of letting you play as Starfleet officers and emulate Trek episodes, with a number of well regarded missions for it. I love Trek, and I've heard STA is a lot of fun. Savage Worlds Savage Worlds is a fun, flexible universal system for all kinds of games (the tagline is fast! furious! fun!). It lets you play skilled, competent characters who can do all sorts of things. Initiative is determined by drawing from a deck of cards, and you get a pool of tokens that let you reroll dice, or add story elements. Because Savage Worlds is so flexible and fun, it's allowed for the creation of lots of amazing premade Savage Worlds settings with the same ruleset: Deadlands: pulpy horror adventures in the weird West of 1884, where you can be (for example) a gunfighter, a card-slinging sorceror, or a mad scientist. Necessary Evil: play as superheroic villains fighting against an alien occupation. In Breakout (which is probably what I'd want to start with), you play villains trapped inside NYC, where you have to fight against other villains (and heroes, and gangs, and maybe some monsters) for food, weapons, and resources. Accursed: \"Universal horror monsters meets Castlevania,\" according to some rando on Drivethrurpg. In a dark fantasy setting, you play as the \"Accursed\" (horror monsters) who are the only ones that can resist the evil of the witches. ... and Savage Worlds works great for lots of other kinds of settings, too, especially pulpy ones. There are lots of other settings that might be fun to play around with with Savage Worlds. For example: Etherscope: a steampunk alternate history from Goodman Games that sounds kinda fun. John Carter of Mars: I found a cheap copy of the core book for the RPG based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' series of Barsoom books, and have literally zero desire to play that RPG. But it'd be a great setting to play Savage Worlds in. Other games that are fun for pickup games Dungeon Crawl Classics A straightforward, fun, often fairly lethal variant of D&D. Spellcasters roll dice to cast spells (with sometimes hilarious or excessive results), fighters are good at stunts and stabbing them with the pointy end, and there are a lot of great adventure modules. Plays best with a decent adventuring party, given the lethality, so we might need four or more players. Monster of the Week A game of fighting monsters and exploring weird goings on, like you've seen on Buffy or the X-Files. Monster of the Week is a Powered by the Apocalypse game (so like Dungeon World or Brindlewood Bay) with solid playbooks and good adventures that can usually wrap up in a few hours. We'd play in my (fictionalized) version of Schoolcraft, Michigan.","title":"Game Menu"},{"location":"game-menu/#game-menu","text":"Here are a few options for fun, chill RPGs we could play every once in a while.","title":"Game Menu"},{"location":"game-menu/#bulldogs","text":"In Bulldogs!, you play a group of \"freebooting ruffians flying from planet to planet causing trouble\".
